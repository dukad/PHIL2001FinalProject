# Final Project for PHIL2001 Spring 2025 by Kaden Du

## Overview

This project was made to simulate networked behavior of those participating in games when they are given the option to both choose their strategy and which parter they play the game with. Both the strategy and partner are chosen with the "probe-and-adjust" rule. The rule goes as follows: at a small probability, each player will try something new, i.e. change their partner or their strategy. If it is better than the result they got previously, then they will continue to do that.
